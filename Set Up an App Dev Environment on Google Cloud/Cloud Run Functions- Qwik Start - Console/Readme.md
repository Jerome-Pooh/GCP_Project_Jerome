# Cloud Run Functions: Qwik Start ‚Äì Console

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create, deploy, and test a **Cloud Run function** using the **Google Cloud Console**. Cloud Run provides a **serverless, event-driven** environment for executing lightweight HTTP-triggered functions without managing infrastructure.

Cloud Run functions are ideal for:

* Executing tasks in response to specific cloud events
* Handling real-time HTTP requests
* Running code on demand without needing an always-on server

---

## üìã What You‚Äôll Do

1. Create a Cloud Run function using the Google Cloud Console.
2. Deploy the function with default sample code.
3. Test the deployed function using a built-in testing tool.
4. View real-time logs.
5. Verify your understanding through a short quiz.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Access to the **Google Cloud Console**
* A **Google Cloud project** with **billing enabled**
* Required APIs enabled (Cloud Run, Cloud Build, and Artifact Registry)

---

## üöÄ Task 1: Create a Cloud Run Function

1. **Navigate to Cloud Run:**

   * Open the Google Cloud Console.
   * From the Navigation menu (‚ò∞), go to **Cloud Run**.

2. **Start a new function:**

   * Click **WRITE A FUNCTION**.

3. **Configure the function:**

   | Field                           | Value                             |
   | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | **Service Name**                | `gcfunction`                      |
   | **Region**                      | `REGION` *(e.g., us-central1)*    |
   | **Authentication**              | Allow unauthenticated invocations |
   | **Memory Allocated**            | Leave default                     |
   | **Execution Environment**       | Second generation                 |
   | **Maximum Number of Instances** | 5                                 |

   * If prompted, click **ENABLE** to activate the necessary APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Task 2: Deploy the Function

1. In the **Source code** section, keep the default provided inline function:

   ```javascript
   exports.helloHttp = (req, res) => {
     const message = req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
     res.send(`Hello ${message}`);
   };
   ```

2. Click **SAVE AND REDEPLOY** to deploy the function.

3. Wait for the green checkmark that indicates successful deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ Task 3: Test the Function

1. On the **function details dashboard**, click **TEST**.

2. In the **Triggering event** field, paste:

   ```json
   {
     "message": "Hello World!"
   }
   ```

3. Click **Test the function**.

4. Output should be:

   ```
   Hello Hello World!
   ```

5. For CLI testing, copy the provided curl command and run it in **Cloud Shell** to invoke the endpoint directly.

---

## üìÑ Task 4: View Logs

1. On the **Service Details Overview** page, go to the **Logs** tab.

2. You‚Äôll see logs generated by your function, including invocation details, responses, and any errors.

3. Use logs to:

   * Debug issues
   * Monitor usage
   * Validate the behavior of your function

---

## ‚ùì Task 5: Test Your Understanding

Answer the following questions to validate your learning:

**Q1:** Cloud Run functions is a serverless execution environment for event-driven services on Google Cloud.
‚úÖ **True**

**Q2:** Which type of trigger is used while creating Cloud Run functions in this lab?
‚úÖ **HTTPS**

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

You‚Äôve successfully:

* Created a serverless HTTP-triggered Cloud Run function
* Deployed and invoked the function via the Google Cloud Console
* Monitored your function‚Äôs activity through logs

Cloud Run is a powerful tool for building scalable, lightweight applications that respond to events across your Google Cloud infrastructure.
